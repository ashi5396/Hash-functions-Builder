# Hash-functions-Builder
This project was done for Cpts 223 (Washington State University's course) by myself and my friend. This program has two parts. 
In the first part we would read two files. Once the first file is read in, it would do different insertions into the hash table. 
Such as chaining, linear and quadratic. It will calculate the total time it took to insert, average time as well as number of collisions. 
Once the second file is read in, it would do the searching with different hash functions such as chaining, linear and quadratic. It will 
also calculate the total time it took to do insertion,average time. The second part would read same two files and would do the same 
operations.However, it would do those operations with functions such as simple,prefix and full.
